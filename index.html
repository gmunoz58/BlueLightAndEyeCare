                    Understanding Blue Light:<br>What Is It & Why Does It Matter

                <p class="fs-3">
                    Blue light is a high-energy, short-wavelength light that comes not only from the sun but also from
                    screens, LED lights, and digital devices we use daily. Understanding its effects is crucial for
                    anyone looking to protect their eyes and maintain a healthy balance with their screen time.

                    Blue Light and Your Eyes:<br>The Impact on Vision and Health
                </h1>
                <p class="fs-3">
                    Prolonged exposure to blue light can lead to digital eye strain, disrupt sleep, and even impact
                    long-term eye health. Research suggests that blue light exposure may increase the risk of
                    age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss. By adopting blue light-reducing
                    strategies, such as screen filters and mindful device usage, individuals can help protect their eyes
                    and support better overall health.

                <p class="fs-3">
                    The 20-20-20 rule can help protect your eyes from blue light. The 20-20-20 rule suggests taking a
                    20-second break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away, helping to relax eye muscles and
                    reduce strain. Regular breaks like this can prevent symptoms of digital eye strain, including
                    headaches, dryness, and blurred vision.

                <p class="fs-3">
                    Another way to reduce blue light exposure and ease eye strain is by wearing blue light-blocking
                    glasses. These glasses filter out some blue light from screens, which can help prevent discomfort
                    like headaches, dry eyes, and blurred vision, especially when using devices in low-light or before
                    bed. Although studies on their effectiveness vary, many people find them beneficial for prolonged
                    screen time.
